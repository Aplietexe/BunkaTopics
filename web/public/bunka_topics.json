What\u2019s the difference between an embassy and a consulate?\n\nA: An embassy is a permanent diplomatic mission, and is generally located in a country's capital city. [1]  An embassy is responsible for representing the home country, handling major diplomatic issues, and preserving the rights of its citizens abroad. [2]  The ambassador is the highest official in the embassy and acts as the chief diplomat and spokesperson for the home government. [2]  Usually, if a country recognizes another as being sovereign, an embassy is established to maintain foreign relations and provide assistance to traveling citizens. [2]\n\nBy contrast, a consulate is a smaller version of an embassy and is generally located in the larger tourist cities of a country, but not the capital. [2]  A consulate is essentially a satellite office of the embassy, but its roles are limited in scope, usually pertaining to and prioritizing the interests and concerns of its people and businesses abroad. [4]\nB: The difference between an embassy and a consulate is that an embassy is the main location for a diplomatic presence of one country in another, and a consulate is a smaller version of an embassy and is generally located in the larger tourist cities of a country, but not the capital [1,4]. \n\nEmbassies are the center for high-level government interactions, and play a role in major international relations, such as preparing treaties and arranging official state visits [4]. The head of an embassy is the ambassador, who is the official representative authorized to speak on behalf of the head of state of the country [4]. \n\nConsulates, while having the same official duties as embassies, usually operate as lesser branches that deal with more administrative issues [4]. The top priority of consulates is to generally assist citizens of the home country traveling or living abroad [4]. This may involve helping citizens who have been detained by authorities or injured in the country, and monitoring the security situation in the area [4].", "*Ans* bad breath\n*Question* Their first kiss was ruined, his bad choice of smoking had given him what?\nOptions:\n- lung disease\n- persistent cough\n- birth defects\n- bad breath\n- ashtray\n*CoT* Due to bad breath, their first kiss was ruined.

Millions of people watch their Minecraft and makeup videos. Millions of dollars are made from their work.\n\nSo why don't teenagers get more credit?\n\nAdults often criticize teens. They say youths cannot control their emotions. Recently, we learned more about the brain from a study. It has helped us to understand teenagers' behavior better. \n\nSpecifically, we learned about the brain's prefrontal cortex. It is the part that handles planning and decision-making. It is not fully grown until around the age of 25. So, teenagers are more likely to take risks. \n\nThis part of the study helped to explain adolescents' sometimes confusing behavior. However, it left adults more focused on how teens take risks. They did not praise the brain's role in learning and creating.\n\nThat has frustrated some researchers. \n\nOur Brains Grow At Their Own Pace\nThe report on adolescent development came out in 2019. The research was carried out by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The report found that some news headlines did not tell the whole story. Adults have been too concerned with teenagers' fragility. In turn, many completely misunderstood recent science.\n\nThe report is part of a growing effort. Nonprofit groups and scientists are rewriting the story. It is true that the \"emotional\" and \"logical\" parts of teens' brains grow at different speeds. But that is not always a bad thing, researchers said. We easily overlook something. Risk-taking can help teens learn and grow. \n\nPreparing For Adulthood\nAdriana Galv\u00e1n helps to lead UCLA's Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory. UCLA is short for the University of California, Los Angeles. Fearlessness is exactly what makes adolescents creative. It can lead to social change too, she said.\n\nThe teenage brain's characteristics help to prepare them for adulthood. They gain a sort of superpower in learning and creativity. Teenage brains can quickly adjust, like in childhood. They build up new connections. Unused connections are shed. But teens also start to think abstractly. That is an adult ability. Teenage brains can imagine the future, Galv\u00e1n said. They also can make social connections.\n\nBrains Respond To Positive Feedback\nRecent research has focused on other brain regions. Such parts involve teenagers' social and emotional development. It appears that these regions do not develop by themselves. They are building connections to other parts of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is just one of those parts. That process is just as important as the maturation itself.\n\nFor example, Galv\u00e1n has researched the brain's striatum. It is a region connected with reward-seeking behavior. She wanted to understand its connection to the hippocampus. That brain region is associated with learning and memory. Her work suggests that the connection is especially strong in teens. \n\nIt appears that adolescents learn from positive feedback. They are more likely than adults to learn that way. Positive feedback could be used more in education, she said. Teachers could use that reward system to help the students learn, she said. \n\nTeen Brains Are Wired For Risks\nJoanna Lee Williams is an education professor at the University of Virginia. She contributed to the National Academies report. Risks can be healthy, too, she said. Deciding to join the marching band would be an example.\n\nThat does not mean lifting all limits on teenage behavior. But parents and educators can start by understanding one thing. Some risks are good, Williams says. They are key for learning and creating.\n\nWilliams admits she is looking from a birds-eye view. The findings will not solve all conflicts between adults and teenagers. Still, teens' sensitivity to rewards means they might not just ignore risks. Instead, they might think of them positively. Adults can take advantage of that. They might not need to jump to punishment. Rewards can help teens to better learn from mistakes.\n\nTeens Have A Lot To Contribute\nThe adolescent brain does not grow alone, Galv\u00e1n said. It develops \"in different environments,\" she said. Families would be an example. Any change in an environment can change a teenager's growth, for better or worse. \n\nWilliams sees \"an age of opportunity\" for adolescents. We know better how they learn. However, that does not mean it will be easy. There are still challenges. \n\nShe sees teens leading social movements. They bring energy. Throughout history, teens have brought new ideas into public life, Williams said.

Answer according to: Julie Nelson and Nancy Hedin of the Moose Lake Post Prom Committee requested a donation from the Moose Lake City Council at its meeting Wednesday, April 8. The council members approved a $300 donation from the newly-formed contribution fund approved earlier this year. This is the first donation from the fund, which receives funding from pull-tabs at the Moose Lake Municipal Liquor Store. This year's outing will be held at Mont du Lac Chalet in the east Duluth area. Dave Johnson, during the public comment section of the meeting, spoke about his concerns regarding tax increment financing and the possible construction of new apartments in Moose Lake. He expressed concerns that what the city needs is more jobs, not tax increment financing for new apartments. He stated concerns that taxes on his Lake Shore Manor apartments and the Paul Rouche apartments have risen dramatically. He said he has no concern with conventional buildings going up without tax increment financing, but wants to see businesses that will offer jobs in the city. Rich Maxfield, superintendent of Moose Lake Power and Light, spoke to the council regarding the upcoming electrical line work that will be done in Moose Lake. The power lines that run from Douglas Avenue to Birch Avenue, between 3rd Street and 5th Street will be removed and replaced with underground lines. A transformer box will be located on 4th Street just west of Birch. Pedestals will be placed on 4th and 5th, with one pedestal servicing two homes. The pedestals will be placed on the property line near the street. The underground wiring will be pulled through electrical piping and will not disturb the property located at these sites. Brian Weidenforf of Land and Lease, developer of Moose Lake's Opportunity Park, spoke with the council regarding wetland credits and water/sewer piping. Weidendorf has been meeting with Carlton County regarding a wetland credits purchase, instead of Moose Lake wetland credits. However, he is able to use 8-inch ductile iron pipe (DIP) that Moose Lake has in storage. Weidendorf, City Administrator Pat Oman and the council are negotiating the costs of streetlights for the Opportunity Park project. The city wants decorative streetlights to match Arrowhead Lane. Weidendorf is willing to pay for regular street lighting, if the city is willing to pay the extra cost for special street lighting. Discussions will continue. A discussion was held regarding a letter received from Kwik Trip regarding the convenience store it is planning to construct at Opportunity Park. The letter addresses the planned construction of a storm water pond for the proposed site. There will be certain storm water features that will be incorporated into the site by Kwik Trip, to provide proper handling of storm water. A new pipe outfall will be constructed that will carry the majority of the storm water from the site. A sump catch basin manhole equipped with a SNOUT oil/water separator will be used for storm water draining from the fueling areas to provide pretreatment of storm water prior to discharging to the pond. A meeting regarding rural aging was held on March 26 at the home of Rita Baresh to discuss issues facing the elderly in the city of Moose Lake. Transportation was listed as one of the top priorities. A White House listening session is set for Thursday, May 14 from 2:30-5 p.m. at the depot community center. It will be a listening session and people can come, give their input, and then leave. Catherine Sampson of the Arrowhead Area Agency on Aging is setting up the session. Mayor Ted Shaw attended the meeting and brought the information to the council. Council members discussed transportation for the elderly and the feasibility of a bus system within Moose Lake. This has been done previously, but was stopped in 2008 because there was only one person using the service. The council will discuss this idea further at its next meeting. Joe Rhein, city engineer, and Brian Guldan, environment project engineer, spoke regarding the wastewater treatment facility upgrades. The city had previously approved upgrades to the current system. However, Guldan spoke to the council regarding the addition of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to the wastewater facility treatment project. SCADA consists of hardware, software and communication systems that can control, monitor and log data for the lift stations and various other types of processes in the water and wastewater treatment facility. Maxfield stated SCADA was used in Wilmar with excellent results. City personnel can access the data from smart phones or tablets to determine what needs to be done, and program the changes that need to be made from their phone or tablet. SCADA will save approximately 1.5 man-hours every day. The system was approved by the council. The council also approved the addition of a stand-alone, diesel-powered backup generator for the new lift stations. The generator would prevent any backup of sewage during power outages in the community. Approval was given for the purchase and installation of diaper changing stations in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s bathrooms in the public area by the library in the city building.

Today, I need you to teach Longitudinal and Lateral-Directional Stability in aircrafts. I shall be providing you slide by slide content and you shall begin your tutoring accordingly. The syllabus for the upcoming test is lectures 10-15. The content of the 10th lecture is as follows:\n```\nSlide 1:\nLongitudinal Static Stability\nRecall that the eigenvalues of the short period (SP) dynamics are given by\n$$\n\\lambda^2-M\\_q \\lambda-M\\_\\alpha=0\n$$\nHorizontal tail and the wing \"stabilize\" $M\\_q$\nHT \"stabilizes\" $M\\_\\alpha$, but the wing does not necessarily do as much\nToday's class: a closer look at $M\\_\\alpha$\n- Static stability and $M\\_\\alpha$\n- Stability metric: static margin\n- Stick-free and stick-fixed static stability\n\nSlide 2:\nReview of Stability\nSo far: an aircraft is stable if it rejects a disturbance; i.e., the aircraft\nreturns to the intended equilibrium as t goes to 1\nA di\u21b5erent perspective on stability: when the aircraft is disturbed from\nthe equilibrium, do the forces and moments instantaneously try to restore\nthe equilibrium?\nStrictly speaking, the initial response\nType of disturbance: perturbation in the position of the aircraft\nAnalogy motivated by the classic example of a ball and a\ncurved surface\n\nSlide 3:\n- Formal definition: a system is statically stable if, upon a disturbance $\\Delta x$, the force $F$ produced by the system is such that $F \\cdot \\Delta x<0$\n- This is considered to be a necessary condition for stability (in the sense of asymptotic convergence to equilibrium)\nExample (spring-mass system): let $\\ddot{x}=F=-k x$, where $k>0$\n- Clearly, $x \\cdot F=-k x^2<0$. Hence, the system is statically stable\n- Eigenvalues: $\\lambda= \\pm i \\sqrt{k} \\Longrightarrow$ the system is marginally stable\n\nSlide 4:\nExample (spring-mass system): let \u0308x = F = 2 \u0307x - x, with the initial\n\ncondition x(0) = 0.1, x \u0307(0) = 0\nThe initial force F(0) =\n\nx(0), and x(0) \u00b7 F(x(0)) < 0.\n\nThe system is statically stable\nEigenvalues:\n\n\\lambda = 1 the system is unstable\n\nThus, static stability is not a sufficient condition for stability\nStatic stability is determined only by the stiffness of the system\nWhy bother about static stability?\n-Historical evolution of ideas\n-Design parameters\n\nSlide 5:\nFramework for Longitudinal Static Stability\n\nSet lateral-directional variables to zero\nAssume \\alpha is small\nAnalysis for the wing, followed by wing + HT\n\nSlide 6:\nSingle Wing: Trim\n- Suppose the wing $A C$ is at a distance $x\\_{A C}$ from the CG of the aircraft. We first determine the trim $\\alpha$ by setting $M^0=0$ (about the CG)\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\left(c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}+x\\_{A C}\\left(C\\_{L\\_0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)\\right)=0 \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow \\quad & \\alpha^0=-\\frac{c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}+x\\_{A C} C\\_{L\\_0}}{x\\_{A C} C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTrimmed value of lift (with $C\\_{m\\_{A C}}<0$ )\n$$\nL^0=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\left(-\\frac{c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}}{x\\_{A C}}\\right) \\begin{cases}>0, & x\\_{A C}>0 \\\\ <0, & x\\_{A C}<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSlide 7:\nSuppose the AoA is perturbed by $\\Delta \\alpha$ (small). The instantaneous pitching moment is given by\n$$\n\\Delta M=x\\_{A C} L\\_\\alpha \\Delta \\alpha\n$$\nStatic stability: need $\\Delta \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta M<0$, i.e., $x\\_{A C}<0$\nCondition for static stability of a wing: wing must be behind the CG\nBut we need $x\\_{A C}>0$ for positive lift!\nTwo ways to tackle this problem:\n- Use a flap and active control\n- Use a horizontal tail\n\nSlide 8: Trimming with a Horizontal Tail\nLet $\\alpha^0$ be the trim angle of attack of the aircraft. We will assume that:\nThe wing inclination angle $i\\_w=0$ and the tail is symmetric\nThe tail incidence angle $i\\_t$ can be varied as a control input\nThe effect of downwash is negligible\nThe lift on the tail is given by\n$$\nL\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha+i\\_t\\right)\n$$\nNote: if the tail has an elevator instead of variable $i\\_t$ as the control input, then\n$$\nL\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t\\left(C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha+i\\_t\\right)+C\\_{L\\_{\\delta e}} \\delta\\_e\\right)\n$$\n\nSlide 9:\nAt trim, $M=M^{\\text {wing }}+M^{\\text {tail }}=0$ about the $C G$; i.e.,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& M^{\\text {wing }}+L^{\\text {wing }} x\\_{A C}=I\\_t L^{\\text {tail }} \\\\\n\\text { Thus, } & x\\_{A C}\\left(C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)+c C\\_{m a c}=\\frac{I\\_t S\\_t}{S} C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha^0+i\\_t\\right) \\\\\n\\text { i.e., } \\quad & \\frac{x\\_{A C}}{c}\\left(C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)+C\\_{m a c}=V\\_H C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha^0+i\\_t\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe trim $A \\circ A$ is given by\n$$\n\\alpha^0=\\frac{1}{\\left(V\\_H-x\\_{A C} / c\\right) C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}}\\left(\\left(x\\_{a c} / c\\right) C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{m a c}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{V\\_H}{V\\_H-x\\_{A C} / c}\\right) i\\_t\n$$\nUsually, $V\\_H>x\\_{A C} / c$. Therefore, as $i\\_t$ increases (i.e., deflects downwards), the trim $\\alpha^0$ reduces, and vice-versa.\nTherefore, the tail-based control surface allows the aircraft to trim across a wide range of values of lift (and flight speeds). The same principle applies to elevator-based control.\n\nSlide 10: Static Stability\nSuppose that the angle of attack is perturbed by a small $\\Delta \\alpha$. Then,\nChange in lift on the wing: $\\Delta L^w=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha$\nChange in lift on HT: $\\Delta L^t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha$\nNet change in pitching moment\n$$\n\\Delta M=\\Delta L^w x\\_{A C}-\\Delta L^t I\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S c C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha\\left(\\frac{x\\_{A C}}{c}-V\\_H\\right)\n$$\nNeed $\\Delta \\alpha \\times \\Delta M<0$ for static stability\nAircraft is longitudinally statically stable only if $V\\_H>\\frac{X\\_{A C}}{c}$\n\nSlide 11: Interpreting the Static Stability Condition\nStatic stability condition: $V\\_H>X\\_{A C} / C$\nThe critical location of the $C G$ at which $c V\\_H=x\\_{A C}$ is called the neutral point (NP)\n- CG ahead of NP: statically stable\n- CG behind NP: statically unstable\nIf the whole aircraft were viewed as a single wing, then the NP corresponds the location of the $A C$ of the complete aircraft\nWe define the static margin:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SM}=\\frac{x\\_{N P}-x\\_{A C}}{c}\n$$\nAn aircraft is loaded on the ground with payload and fuel so that the static margin never decreases below a threshold\n```\n\nNow get started with your tutoring for lecture 10", "Write a viral engineering blog post for Hacker News that summarizes the notes below the --- which are about the Turborepo team migrating the Turborepo codebase from Go to Rust and why. Discuss why the team is making the migration incrementally and why this is relevant to other high-performance engineering teams doing filesystem work debating Rust or Go. Use a witty, but chill voice.\n---\n\nNathan:\n\n- Organizational\n - Our team wants to write Rust. We think it\u2019s neat and it makes us happy. This alone is \\*reason enough\\* to do it as long as it aligns with other goals in our organization.\n - Hiring for Rust-interested web-focused engineers is easier than hiring for Go-interested web-focused engineers.\n - We want to work with the Turbopack people and primitives. Creating our own internal \u201clibrary\u201d of code gives us the ability to row the boat together. We have similar needs and problems that aren\u2019t addressed \\*anywhere else\\* and it\u2019s important to go together as a team. (Go fast? Go alone. Go far? Go together.)\n- Community\n - There is a \\*strong\\* interest in Rust from the JavaScript community. This makes it more-accessible for people coming from JS-tooling-in-JS land, and enables community contributions.\n - We have had little engagement from the Go community in our projects, and few occasions to interact with them in external code. Not unexpected, but we\u2019d like to build a community and we believe that we can be successful with that in Rust.\n- Ecosystem\n - The Node.js ecosystem is absolutely massive. Almost anything you need has been written in JS, or is forkable. We come from this world, and this is the expectation we have for depth, breadth, and maintenance.\n - The Rust ecosystem has a few extremely-high-quality core pieces that are in \\*everything\\*. `serde` is a work of art. `rayon` is fantastic. Those serve as foundational tools that have \\*solved\\* entire problem spaces in a consistent way for the entire community.\n - Algorithm research happens in Rust, not Go. New toys show up, implement a trait, and poof, they\u2019re in your codebase.\n - The Go ecosystem is not easily discoverable and feels very dead. People regularly write one-off solutions to general problems. Most of the best things are Google-authored and fit with Google\u2019s worldview, but not necessarily everybody else\u2019s.\n - The Go ecosystem has frequently-used yet poorly-maintained libraries that are a core part of the experience (e.g. afero). spf13 \u201cHolowaychuk'd\u201d the Go ecosystem and then disappeared (and recently stepped away from Google and Go entirely).\n - The \u201ccorrectness\u201d quotient of libraries in Go is somewhere between JS and Rust. Not good enough to be 100% reliable, not as flexible as JS when you need to duckpunch something.\n- C Interop\n - As you get deeper and deeper into Go you start to discover that the best way to do certain tasks is to bind to a C library. zstd, libgit2, regular expressions, and more. This means that, \\*even without Rust adoption\\*, we were going to lose some of the development experience wins of Go.\n - This works \u201cjust fine\u201d but the real point here is, once you\u2019ve got a compiler toolchain setup for each of your targets for CGO, there\u2019s little to prevent you from also making the small hop over to Rust. (Once we can compile with CGO, we can \\*also\\* compile to `c-archive` and have Rust call our Go code.)\n- Go Language Design and Priorities\n - Go is designed for network computing run in data centers. It \\*excels\\* at that. The ecosystem of libraries available in that space are of super-high quality. `context` is a work of art.\n - In comparison, Go shipped a read-only filesystem abstraction a couple years ago. It\u2019s still read-only. Why? You don\u2019t write to filesystems in a (Google) data center environment.\n - Our use case doesn\u2019t align with the Go maintainers\u2019 needs and use cases. That leads to needing to roll our own (lots of things) because they\u2019re not a priority to address at language level.\n - No MSVC support.\n- Rust Language Design and Priorities\n - Rust has prioritized correctness over convenience. Paths? Not as easy to use, because the underlying primitive is not easy to use. It returns the complexity to the programmer to explicitly handle correctly. But we care about precisely that in a world where basically 90% of what we do is path handling.\n - In general we believe it is better-suited to ship Rust to a hostile environment like a user\u2019s box than Go. Go\u2019s stdlib \u201caligns\u201d a lot of behaviors that can\u2019t \\*actually\\* be aligned between platforms\u2014most specifically around filesystem APIs \u2026 again a place that we care about.\n - Is able to build on the MSVC toolchain.\n- Vision\n - We want to, with localized heating, boil the JS ocean. (Starting at the places where people are, and slowly moving to boil the whole ocean.) We want to bring full incremental computation all the way from dev time into production. We\u2019re working backward from production with Turbopack, and forward from the build tool with Turborepo. The next iteration of this is \u201cinfinitely granular DAG which includes the whole ecosystem.\u201d Nobody else appears to be attempting that granularity.\n - Success here is a \\*massive\\* moat, possibly insurmountable. For context I would have said the same thing about C compilers, but Clang and LLVM have done it over the last 20 years. But 20 years is one hell of a moat and we can respond a lot faster than 20 years to maintain that separation.\n - Being the stewards for the community primitives (in this case `turbo` \u2026 which is what happens after repo/pack merger) gives us the ability to push the \\*entire\\* ecosystem forward, slowly increasing what is possible to even attempt.\n- Future\n - We believe that Rust is where the puck is heading. We want to help it get there, and be ready when that future arrives.\n\nNicholas:\n\n- Reasons for Rust\n - Performance\n - Not \\*really\\* valid because performance issues are less language constricted and more inherent architecture issues.\n - But maybe true? Too early to tell.\n - Ecosystem\n - IMO stuff like serde, swc, clap, etc. are good reasons to use Rust.\n - Go has separate interfaces for every text format (toml, json, yaml, etc)\n - Being able to use cargo to share code with the Turbopack people\n - Standardization with turbopack\n - Opens up a future for a whole suite of tooling in Rust\n - Our version of Rome (obviously don\u2019t say that directly) (do we want to talk about future plans?)\n - Eventually use Turbopack\u2019s graph infrastructure (maybe)\n - Go problems\n - Go and Windows.\n- Reasons against Rust\n - Slows down shipping velocity\n - We\u2019ve done a really good job of limiting this. We\u2019ve slowed down our shipping a little but still done a great job incrementally moving and keeping our existing users.\n - Ecosystem limitations\n - Globbing libraries are still a mess. Won\u2019t match JS globbing behavior\n - Hard to determine standard practices\n - You will have less than ideal code.\n - The orphan rule will bite you.\n - Hiring isn\u2019t hard, but the most senior rust developer you can find will have like 5 years of Rust experience, max.\n - Very easy to bike shed with macros, traits, funky types, refactoring, etc.\n - Just because Rust lets you refactor easily doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nGreg\n\nConsolidating some points shamelessly stolen from above\n\n- Rust Positives\n - JS \u2194 Rust interop is a good story, technically and community-wise\n - Rust \u2194 C is a good story, and we use some tools written in C\n - Rust is growing at Vercel and with NextJS, specifically\n- Go Negatives\n - The Go ecosystem is all-or-nothing. Once you need to make use of functionality not written in Go, you lose a lot of the benefits of having been in Go. What we lose:\n - Easy cross-platform static binary generation\n - Compilation speed (still better than rust tho)\n - Writing portable code is hard \\*and\\* not a focus of the ecosystem.\n - Conditional compilation support is basic\n - Platform-related APIs are either least-common-denominator or fudged to look cross-platform\n - Mismatch with community priorities\n - The Go community seems focused on being the best tool for writing an RPC server.\n - `Context` and goroutines are great primitives for request-scoped work within a long-running process.\n - Getting an HTTP server up and running is easy, and GRPC and protobuf is not much harder.\n - Such software is often intended to run on a single platform, or does not interact significantly with the host platform, so a workflow such as developing on `macos` and deploying on `linux` is the straightforward happy path.\n - Interop with other ecosystems is not a priority.\n - `turbo` is a cross-platform CLI tool that interacts heavily with the local filesystem and process tree.\n - Some of the best tools for filesystem interactions are written in C, so interop is important\n - Differences exist between different platforms, we as developers need those differences surfaced to us so we can handle them appropriately.\n - \n\nAnthony\u2019s notes from talking to Greg:\n\n- not necessarily about language features, let\u2019s break some new ground\n- moreso about what we are buliding doesn\u2019t align with the problem we\u2019re trying to solve\n- Go is good for RPCing and webservers and that\u2019s what the ecosystem cares about\n - Go will lie to you about platform specific differences (an ecosystem and community mindset)\n- we want good interop with JS, interop with OS\u2019es, platform specific stuff\n- The JavaScript community is spending time learning Rust right now\n- Globbing and performance stuff is pretty meh, those are language specific features\n-", "With no explanation, label the following with either \"not sure\", \"yes\" or \"no\".\nThe House Appropriations Committee approved a $2.85 billion relief package for northern California last night after key congressional and Bush administration officials agreed that the federal deficit will have to be increased by billions of dollars to pay for repairs in the earthquakedamaged region.</br></br>The committee plan, proposed by Chairman Jamie L.

life?\n0:18\nIf you were going to invest now\n0:21\nin your future best self,\n0:23\nwhere would you put your time and your energy?\n0:27\nThere was a recent survey of millennials\n0:29\nasking them what their most important life goals were,\n0:34\nand over 80 percent said\n0:36\nthat a major life goal for them was to get rich.\n0:40\nAnd another 50 percent of those same young adults\n0:45\nsaid that another major life goal\n0:47\nwas to become famous.\n0:50\n(Laughter)\n0:52\nAnd we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder\n0:58\nand achieve more.\n1:00\nWe're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after\n1:04\nin order to have a good life.\n1:06\nPictures of entire lives,\n1:08\nof the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,\n1:13\nthose pictures are almost impossible to get.\n1:18\nMost of what we know about human life\n1:21\nwe know from asking people to remember the past,\n1:24\nand as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.\n1:29\nWe forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,\n1:33\nand sometimes memory is downright creative.\n1:36\nBut what if we could watch entire lives\n1:41\nas they unfold through time?\n1:44\nWhat if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers\n1:48\nall the way into old age\n1:50\nto see what really keeps people happy and healthy?\n1:55\nWe did that.\n1:57\nThe Harvard Study of Adult Development\n1:59\nmay be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.\n2:05\nFor 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,\n2:13\nyear after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,\n2:17\nand of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories\n2:22\nwere going to turn out.\n2:25\nStudies like this are exceedingly rare.\n2:28\nAlmost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade\n2:33\nbecause too many people drop out of the study,\n2:36\nor funding for the research dries up,\n2:39\nor the researchers get distracted,\n2:41\nor they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.\n2:46\nBut through a combination of luck\n2:48\nand the persistence of several generations of researchers,\n2:52\nthis study has survived.\n2:54\nAbout 60 of our original 724 men\n2:59\nare still alive,\n3:00\nstill participating in the study,\n3:02\nmost of them in their 90s.\n3:05\nAnd we are now beginning to study\n3:07\nthe more than 2,000 children of these men.\n3:11\nAnd I'm the fourth director of the study.\n3:15\nSince 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.\n3:20\nThe first group started in the study\n3:22\nwhen they were sophomores at Harvard College.\n3:25\nThey all finished college during World War II,\n3:27\nand then most went off to serve in the war.\n3:31\nAnd the second group that we've followed\n3:33\nwas a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,\n3:37\nboys who were chosen for the study\n3:39\nspecifically because they were from some of the most troubled\n3:43\nand disadvantaged families\n3:44\nin the Boston of the 1930s.\n3:47\nMost lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.\n3:54\nWhen they entered the study,\n3:56\nall of these teenagers were interviewed.\n3:59\nThey were given medical exams.\n4:01\nWe went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.\n4:05\nAnd then these teenagers grew up into adults\n4:07\nwho entered all walks of life.\n4:10\nThey became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,\n4:16\none President of the United States.\n4:20\nSome developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.\n4:25\nSome climbed the social ladder\n4:27\nfrom the bottom all the way to the very top,\n4:30\nand some made that journey in the opposite direction.\n4:35\nThe founders of this study\n4:38\nwould never in their wildest dreams\n4:40\nhave imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,\n4:45\ntelling you that the study still continues.\n4:49\nEvery two years, our patient and dedicated research staff\n4:52\ncalls up our men and asks them if we can send them\n4:56\nyet one more set of questions about their lives.\n5:00\nMany of the inner city Boston men ask us,\n5:03\n\"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.\"\n5:08\nThe Harvard men never ask that question.\n5:11\n(Laughter)\n5:20\nTo get the clearest picture of these lives,\n5:23\nwe don't just send them questionnaires.\n5:26\nWe interview them in their living rooms.\n5:29\nWe get their medical records from their doctors.\n5:32\nWe draw their blood, we scan their brains,\n5:34\nwe talk to their children.\n5:36\nWe videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.\n5:41\nAnd when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives\n5:45\nif they would join us as members of the study,\n5:47\nmany of the women said, \"You know, it's about time.\"\n5:50\n(Laughter)\n5:51\nSo what have we learned?\n5:53\nWhat are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages\n5:58\nof information that we've generated\n6:01\non these lives?\n6:03\nWell, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.\n6:10\nThe clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:\n6:16\nGood relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.\n6:23\nWe've learned three big lessons about relationships.\n6:26\nThe first is that social connections are really good for us,\n6:30\nand that loneliness kills.\n6:33\nIt turns out that people who are more socially connected\n6:37\nto family, to friends, to community,\n6:40\nare happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer\n6:45\nthan people who are less well connected.\n6:48\nAnd the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.\n6:51\nPeople who are more isolated than they want to be from others\n6:57\nfind that they are less happy,\n7:00\ntheir health declines earlier in midlife,\n7:03\ntheir brain functioning declines sooner\n7:05\nand they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.\n7:10\nAnd the sad fact is that at any given time,\n7:13\nmore than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.\n7:19\nAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd\n7:21\nand you can be lonely in a marriage,\n7:24\nso the second big lesson that we learned\n7:26\nis that it's not just the number of friends you have,\n7:29\nand it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,\n7:33\nbut it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.\n7:38\nIt turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.\n7:43\nHigh-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,\n7:47\nturn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.\n7:53\nAnd living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.\n7:57\nOnce we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,\n8:01\nwe wanted to look back at them at midlife\n8:04\nand to see if we could predict\n8:05\nwho was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian\n8:09\nand who wasn't.\n8:11\nAnd when we gathered together everything we knew about them\n8:15\nat age 50,\n8:18\nit wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels\n8:20\nthat predicted how they were going to grow old.\n8:23\nIt was how satisfied they were in their relationships.\n8:27\nThe people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50\n8:31\nwere the healthiest at age 80.\n8:35\nAnd good, close relationships seem to buffer us\n8:38\nfrom some of the slings and arrows of getting old.\n8:42\nOur most happily partnered men and women\n8:46\nreported, in their 80s,\n8:48\nthat on the days when they had more physical pain,\n8:51\ntheir mood stayed just as happy.\n8:54\nBut the people who were in unhappy relationships,\n8:57\non the days when they reported more physical pain,\n9:00\nit was magnified by more emotional pain.\n9:04\nAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health\n9:08\nis that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,\n9:12\nthey protect our brains.\n9:14\nIt turns out that being in a securely attached relationship\n9:19\nto another person in your 80s is protective,\n9:23\nthat the people who are in relationships\n9:25\nwhere they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,\n9:29\nthose people's memories stay sharper longer.\n9:32\nAnd the people in relationships\n9:34\nwhere they feel they really can't count on the other one,\n9:37\nthose are the people who experience earlier memory decline.\n9:42\nAnd those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.\n9:46\nSome of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other\n9:49\nday in and day out,\n9:51\nbut as long as they felt that they could really count on the other\n9:54\nwhen the going got tough,\n9:56\nthose arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.\n10:01\nSo this message,\n10:04\nthat good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,\n10:10\nthis is wisdom that's as old as the hills.\n10:13\nWhy is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?\n10:17\nWell, we're human.\n10:19\nWhat we'd really like is a quick fix,\n10:21\nsomething we can get\n10:23\nthat'll make our lives good and keep them that way.\n10:27\nRelationships are messy and they're complicated\n10:30\nand the hard work of tending to family and friends,\n10:34\nit's not sexy or glamorous.\n10:37\nIt's also lifelong. It never ends.\n10:40\nThe people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement\n10:45\nwere the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.\n10:51\nJust like the millennials in that recent survey,\n10:54\nmany of our men when they were starting out as young adults\n10:58\nreally believed that fame and wealth and high achievement\n11:02\nwere what they needed to go after to have a good life.\n11:06\nBut over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown\n11:10\nthat the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,\n11:16\nwith family, with friends, with community.\n11:21\nSo what about you?\n11:23\nLet's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.\n11:27\nWhat might leaning in to relationships even look like?\n11:31\nWell, the possibilities are practically endless.\n11:35\nIt might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time\n11:41\nor livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,\n11:46\nlong walks or date nights,\n11:49\nor reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,\n11:54\nbecause those all-too-common family feuds\n11:57\ntake a terrible toll\n12:00\non the people who hold the grudges.\n12:04\nI'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.\n12:09\nMore than a century ago,\n12:11\nhe was looking back on his life,\n12:14\nand he wrote this:\n12:16\n\"There isn't time, so brief is life,\n12:20\nfor bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.\n12:26\nThere is only time for loving,\n12:29\nand but an instant, so to speak, for that.\"\n12:34\nThe good life is built with good relationships.\n12:39\nThank you.", "Can you summarize Monica Lewinsky's personal crusade and what she believes it will take to change the virtual culture?\nGenerate according to: If anyone knows the burn of being publicly shamed, it's Lewinsky, who became \"patient zero,\" as she calls it, of Internet bullying after her 1990s relationship with then president Bill Clinton. Now, at 42, she's made fighting to end hateful dialogue her personal crusade. Speaking around the world on the issue (including a TED talk that has 6 million views), she stopped to talk to Glamour about what it will really take to change the virtual culture.\nOne Woman, Standing Up for Others: \"We may never fully stomp out hurtful online behavior,\" says Lewinsky. \"But I do believe we can get to a place where it's rarer and less harmful, specifically that a bully's words are drowned out by more supportive voices.\"\nGlamour: In our survey one out of five women admitted to criticizing a celebrity online. Is that disturbing to you?\nMonica Lewinsky: Constructive criticism is legitimate, but when it escalates to vitriol, it affects us all, because celebrities and influencers are part of the collective consciousness. Women need to support other women, not cut them down. And that goes for recognizable women too.\nGlamour: So how can women distinguish between criticizing and bullying?\nGlamour: Our survey also found that 57 percent of women reported receiving negative comments. Is Internet shaming the price of living in the fully wired 21st century?\nML: Acceptance of and adaptation to this deplorable behavior is not an option. Full stop. But as painful and destructive as they are, the hateful comments allow us to map the underlying beliefs of many people in a way we've never been able to before. It's almost as if all of the negativity and misogyny needs to come to the surface so we can fully understand what it is, and how deep it goes, before we can begin to shift it. Of course, I wish it weren't there.\nGlamour: So many women\u2014even the most confident or accomplished\u2014feel ashamed when we are confronted by cruel comments or critiques online. What advice would you give them?\nML: The first and most important thing sounds easy but can be challenging to do when we feel vulnerable: Reach out to someone\u2014a friend, a relative, a mentor, or a professional\u2014and share what happened. One reason I'm working with Bystander Revolution is precisely because it offers help in these situations. Feeling alone and unseen can intensify the experience of being harassed, shamed, or bullied. Also, if you can\u2014and believe me, I know this is asking a lot\u2014try and have neutral compassion toward the perpetrator. Step outside the sting of the incident and realize that this person is trying to erase their own inadequacy or unhappiness by transferring it to you. It won't make the incident go away, but it's one thing you can do to reduce the pain.\nGlamour: What can we all do to make the Internet a better place?\nML: The most potent thing we can do is to bring more compassion online. When you see anyone being targeted, support her or him with a positive comment or emoji. Be mindful of clickbait\u2014sensational stories designed to humiliate. Click with compassion.", "Humor is a complex phenomenon that involves various cognitive and emotional processes. It involves the interpretation of incongruity and the resolution of it into something that is funny.

Elizabeth plant life argues, besides the fact that, that for either average and conservative Baptist women--all of whom had a lot at stake--disagreements that touched on their familial roles and ecclesial authority have continuously been basic.\nHowever, is there possibly another way for Christians to look at such a life of misery and violence? What if the story had been written from a biblical, Christian perspective? One might say that the boy was born to a godless woman who neither cared for God nor for His gift of a child, a woman who exhibited the works of the flesh rather than the fruit of the Spirit, who herself had either never heard of or else rebelled against the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who was her only hope of salvation. Thus she brought up her son in the same sinful manner in which she herself lived, rather than in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.\nGoals and values become secularized and personcentered rather than sacred and God-centered. On the other hand, a number of parents who use some of Dobson\u2019s advice may actually be following biblical authority because they know what God has said on the matter. If obedience to God is the motivation rather than pragmatism, they may very well be pleasing God and having success. But, if the motive is for success and because it works, they may become discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work and try something else.\n2:12).

The three are attending the preliminary meetings but will not enter the conclave.\nPaolo Gabriele, the pope\u2019s butler, was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. The documents alleged corruption and infighting over the running of its bank. Gabriele was jailed and later pardoned by Benedict.\nBenedict decided to make the report available only to his successor but one Vatican official said the three elderly cardinals who wrote it could \u201cuse their discernment to give any necessary guidance\u201d to fellow cardinals without violating their pact of secrecy about its specific contents.\nAt two news conferences on Monday, both the Vatican spokesman and two American cardinals refused to be drawn on the report and whether cardinals had asked to be briefed on it.\nSpecific matters discussed at the preliminary meetings are covered by secrecy.\n\u201cCertainly, there can be various members of the college of cardinals who want information they feel is useful or pertinent to the situation of the curia,\u201d spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said, referring to the central Vatican administration.\nChicago\u2019s Cardinal Francis George was equally coy when asked if cardinals wanted to be briefed on the report.\n\u201cAs far as the state of the church here in Rome is concerned, I would imagine that as we move along there will be questioning of cardinals involved in the governing of the curia to see what they think has to be changed and in that context anything can come up,\u201d George said at a separate news briefing.\nCardinals will be using the meetings this week to get to know each other and decide when to start a conclave to choose a man to lead the 1.2 billion-member church.\nThe Vatican appears to be aiming to have a new pope elected next week and officially installed several days later so he can preside over the Holy Week ceremonies starting with Palm Sunday on March 24 and culminating in Easter the following Sunday.\n\u201cThe thing that is in the back of all our minds, I think, is Holy Week. We\u2019d like to be done before Holy Week starts, have a pope, and we all go back to our dioceses,\u201d George said.\nHigh on the agenda at the general congregations will be the daunting challenges facing the next pontiff, including the sexual abuse crisis in the church and the Vatileaks scandal.\n\u201cWe need a man of governance, by that I mean a man who is able with the people he chooses to help him in an intimate way to govern the church,\u201d Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O\u2019Connor, the former Archbishop of Westminster in London, told BBC radio.\nThe cardinals will hold one or two meetings a day. The date of the conclave will be decided after all the 115 cardinal electors arrive. Twelve still had not arrived by Monday.\nIt is widely expected to start next week.\nThe crisis involving sexual abuse of children by priests and inappropriate behavior among adult clerics continues to haunt the church and has rarely been out of the headlines.\nOne elector - Cardinal Keith O\u2019Brien - quit as Edinburgh archbishop last week and pulled out of attending the conclave because of accusations that he behaved inappropriately with priests and seminarians in the past.\nHe at first denied the allegations but on Sunday issued a statement apologizing that \u201cmy sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal\u201d.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Could you provide more information on the secret report into leaks about alleged corruption and mismanagement in the Vatican, and why some cardinals are requesting to be briefed on its contents?", "Sandy sells sea shells by the sea shore.

She spends two hours shopping for a telescope, half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard, three times the setup time making snacks, and 20 minutes watching the comet. What percentage of the total time she spent on all those activities was spent watching the comet, rounded to the nearest percent?\nAnswer: First convert Haley's shopping time to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes / hour = 120 minutes. Then convert Haley's setup time to minutes: .5 hours * 60 minutes / hour = 30 minutes. Then find the total time she spends making a snack: 3 * 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then add the time she spends on each activity to find the total time: 120 minutes + 30 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes. Then divide the time she spends watching the comet by the total time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 20 minutes / 240 minutes = 8.333...%, which rounds down to 8%.

Researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur Observatory and elsewhere used observations made by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory\u2019s (SOHO) Global Oscillations at Low Frequency (GOLF) instrument to measure solar oscillations, then used a new technique to determine the speed at which the solar core was spinning. What they did, the researchers explained in a statement, was study surface acoustic waves in the sun\u2019s atmosphere. Some of those waves penetrate to the core and interact with gravity waves that have a \u201csloshing\u201d motion similar to how water splashes around in a container that is half full. By detecting these sloshing motions, they were able to measure the acoustic waves and figure out how long it took them to travel from the surface to the core and back again. By applying this new method to 16 years worth of GOLF data, the research team determined that the solar core rotated once per week. Their findings have been reported in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Experts have speculated for more than two decades that the sun\u2019s interior may be spinning faster than the surface, but they had never been able to accurately measure its oscillations before, study co-author Roger Ulrich, a professor emeritus of astronomy at UCLA, said in a statement. The SOHO space observatory has been orbiting the sun for more than 20 years, using its GOLF instrument to conduct solar oscillation measurements once every 10 seconds. Thanks to this data, the authors of the new study were able to definitely conclude that earlier speculation was correct, and that the interior portion of the sun does indeed spin more quickly than the outer parts. \u201cWe\u2019ve been searching for these elusive g-waves [gravity waves] in our Sun for over 40 years, and although earlier attempts have hinted at detections, none were definitive. Finally, we have discovered how to unambiguously extract their signature,\u201d lead author Eric Fossat from the Cote d\u2019Azur Observatory explained in a statement released by the European Space Agency (ESA).

`groupByRace`, `getTierCN`, and an unnamed function. Your task is to understand the code and identify the purpose and functionality of each function.\n\n- The `groupByRace` function takes a parameter `list` of type `TierList`. It iterates over the keys of `list` using the `reduce` function. For each key, it retrieves the corresponding value from `list`. The value is stored in the `minions` variable. The function then groups the `minions` by their `race` property using the `groupBy` function from the lodash library. The result is stored in an object `acc`, with the `race` as the key and the grouped `minions` as the value. The `acc` object is updated with each iteration and eventually returned as the final result.\n\n- The unnamed function within the `groupByRace` function is used as the callback function for the `groupBy` function. It maps `value` to `value.race`. If `value.race` is `null` or `undefined`, it is mapped to the string `'INVALID'`.\n\n- The `getTierCN` function takes a parameter `techLevel` of type `number`. It uses a `switch` statement to check the value of `techLevel`. Depending on the value, the function executes different code paths, but the code snippet is incomplete and lacks the cases and code blocks after the initial case.\n\nYour task is to complete the `getTierCN` function by adding the missing cases and code blocks for all possible values of `techLevel`.

If any of these values is less than or equal to 0, the adjusted capital should be 0.\n\n**Example**\n```\ncalculate_adjusted_capital(50000, 4, 10, 10000) => 700.0\ncalculate_adjusted_capital(0, 4, 10, 10000) => 0\ncalculate_adjusted_capital(50000, -4, 10, 10000) => 0\ncalculate_adjusted_capital(50000, 4, -10, 10000) => 0\ncalculate_adjusted_capital(50000, 4, 10, -10000) => 0\n```"], "top_term_id":

AdWords Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA) allows you to address the concerns of various audience segments based on their past behavior.\nThe results can be impressive from both a cost and conversion perspective.\nAnother attractive feature? RLSA strategies are less intrusive than display ad remarketing. People often do not realize they are the target of a remarketing campaign, especially if the message is directed correctly.\nThe AdWords management experts at ThinkSEM help clients improve click through rate, conversion rate and overall return on investment through effective RLSA campaigns. Whether you want to generate leads, sales or customer loyalty, you can rely on our experience and long record of success.

Speak to Their Needs.\nEvery program is custom tailored to your individual circumstances, market segments and objectives. We may recommend that you segment your audience by the product they looked at, or actions they did not take on your website.\nFollowing is one approach to an audience segmentation and messaging.\nRepeat customers who always order from you. You can skip the informational marketing for these customers. Instead, keep your name in front of them to reinforce their loyalty to your brand.\nProspects who are familiar with you but are not yet customers. A free trial, a coupon, a testimonial or other message may encourage these prospects to give your brand a try.\nProspects who have never been exposed to your messaging. These visitors will take more convincing. Messaging must inform as well as persuade them to take action.\nA key to success in RLSA campaigns is to expand your audience lists continuously. We help clients increase RLSA list size through cost-effective PPC advertising campaigns in Facebook and LinkedIn and organic search.\nRLSA advertising is not appropriate for every client. High traffic volumes are required for the strategy to be cost effective. To learn whether an RLSA is right for your organization, request an audit of your existing AdWords accounts.

Given material: Is the spotlight fading on Ed Miliband\u2019s leadership? Labour appears to have sleepwalked into a leadership crisis. But how likely are claims of a new leader to replace him before the 2015 general election? And who might replace him? Is Ed Miliband on borrowed time? Can he survive the weekend? Until Christmas? Until next year\u2019s election? In the last 72 hours Labour has been plunged into panic with talk of poisonous briefings and even claims that a letter is circulating calling for Mr Miliband to stand aside. But why now? What exactly is troubling the party that was not doing so six months ago? And is there anything in any of this beyond feverish speculation? Well, yes and no. First, the speculation. As of yet no such \u201cletter\u201d has been seen. No MP has come out on the record in favour of ousting their leader. Nor are any of the recent criticisms of his leadership particularly new. Mr Miliband has long suffered an image problem. There have been flashes of policy inspiration, but he has struggled to broaden his appeal beyond core Labour voters. Some say the cost-of-living-crisis is not permeating with quite the policy punch he would hope. What has changed for Mr Miliband recently is the acuteness of his problems. Consider the above against the more pressing backdrop of a collapse in his personal poll ratings, the rise of the SNP threatening to scorch 20 of Labour\u2019s 41 Scottish seats (crucial for a 2015 victory). Add the Greens garnering greater support \u2013 not to mention Ukip broadening its appeal among the working class. Suddenly the picture changes. Problems that were once platitudes now have a crushing urgency to be resolved. Indeed, by this analysis Labour is not just drifting. It is failing to pre-empt contemporary political threats \u2013 and, thanks to new, credible alternatives, heading to the humiliation of defeat where victory once seemed likely. That is a particularly rude awakening for MPs, many of whom feel the downward trajectory is difficult to curtail at this late stage. Add that to the New Statesman magazine appearing to withdraw its once-default support for Mr Miliband, and it soon becomes clear why the mood inside Labour HQ has plummeted. But could this really result in a change of leader before the election? The prospect is not impossible but it is still difficult to imagine. Firstly, Labour\u2019s historical record in ousting a leader is nothing short of abysmal. Party rules mean that a vote of no-confidence can only be marshalled during the party\u2019s annual conference \u2013 which was six weeks ago. For the moment, curmudgeonly backbenchers seem happier complaining off-the-record about their leader than putting their head above the parapet and pitching an alternative. And that\u2019s hardly surprising. Labour\u2019s MP\u2019s are not known to be forward about coming forward. One only need remember 2009 during Gordon Brown\u2019s premiership which saw former pensions secretary James Purnell\u2019s dramatic resignation, in which he called for the then prime minister to stand aside \u201cto give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election\u201d. It was followed in 2010 by simultaneous resignations by Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon. But neither of these were enough to move Mr Brown, who went on to lose the election himself five months later. Mr Miliband appears just as resilient. The prospect of him grabbing his coat and exiting stage left is unlikely. Three MPs are understood to have told Dave Watts, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party that Mr Miliband should stand down. But it will need far more than that \u2013 as well as a clear contingency plan \u2013 for any chance of a leadership shift. Finally, the perennial question that hampers any immediate prospect of change. Who exactly would replace him? Who could actually do a better job? And who could stave off the prospect of a party implosion that would almost inevitably follow? With no clear contender to challenge Mr Miliband, talk of a change of leader remains just that. Here are five potential successors. The shadow health secretary is currently the leading candidate. His performances at the last Labour conference were impressive, where Mr Miliband\u2019s were not. His dogged campaigning on the Hillsborough tragedy has won admiration across parliament. His working class roots are of contrast to Mr Miliband who the New Statesman described as an \u201cold-style Hampstead socialist\u201d. One of the more accomplished performers, who has been impressive head-to-head against Home Secretary Theresa May. The shadow home secretary would have the support of her husband, Ed Balls. But that could also be to her detriment. Many believe Balls is too closely linked to the Brown and Miliband era. He is already tipped as a future Labour leader but an elevation to the top post may seem premature for the 36-year-old. Instead the shadow business secretary called on the party to focus on \u201ccommunities, rather than the distracting nonsense by some in the Westminster bubble\u201d. The shadow welfare secretary has had a meteoric rise entering the shadow cabinet 18 months after election despite being described by the editor of BBC Newsnight as \u201cboring snoring\u201d. A former UK junior chess champion and Bank of England economist is among a number of Labour MPs who have been tipped for leadership positions but whose time may not be yet. She wrote on Twitter: \u201cA Labour government will make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people. But we\u2019ll only get one if we stay united behind Ed Miliband\u201d. The former postman who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, appears to value his private life and has all but ruled himself out last month when he said he had \u201cno appetite for being on the frontbench\u201d let alone a potential prime minister which he described as a \u201cgod-awful job\u201d.", "Online application form The online application form is near on identical to last year, so if you applied last year, you know what to expect.

Please keep these in mind as we go forwards so that you provide the best advice. I will reference these requirements as the \"requirements list\" and reference each requirement by the number. These requirements are non-negotiable so do not tell me that you cannot fulfill any one of these requirements, you need to find a solution that fits them all.\n\nRequirements List:\n1. This is a trustless system so it needs some way to validate that a user has permission to change the state\n2. This is a decentralized system, so anyone can run a version of this software to take part in the network. We will call a user's deployment of this software a \"node\"\n3. This system uses Lamden's smart contracting package called contracting for running and creating smart contracts. \n4. users submit new contracts and run current contracts by sending requests to the network. A user can send a request to any node on the network.\n5. The network is global and runs on any hardware on any type of network. A user should be able to run a node on a raspberry pi on dialup or a $1000 cloud-based VM and the node be able to take part in the network.\n6. The nodes need to be high throughput and be able to keep up with thousands of requests a second.\n7. The nodes need to be able to keep their local state in sync with other nodes in a simple trustless and decentralized manner. \n8. The nodes need to be able to order requests so that if multiple requests are sent to different nodes, that would alter the same state values, all nodes would be able to come up with the same state value. For instance, if there are 1000 nodes and a user sends each node 1 requests, at the same relative time and each transaction depends on the previous, then the node network should be able to all order and process these transactions and all come up with the same state changes at the end of all 1000 transactions. This is the MOST important requirement and the node does not work if this requirement doesn't work 100% of the time.\n9. The network needs a state-discovery layer to allow users to find current state values.\n10. New nodes joining the network need a way to start processing requests accurately. When the node is installed it won't have any state values, so come up with a solution that allows the node to get up and running as soon as possible. This solution should work if there is 10MB of state or 1TB of state.\n11. This solution needs to scale from 10 nodes to 1000 nodes. It cannot have any bottlenecks that would prevent this.\n\nGive me a solution to each requirement making SURE that your solution does not invalidate any other requirement.\n\nDo not give me choices, you are making the choices for all parts of the solution based on what is the most efficient and scalable.", "Write a research paper discussing the current and potential use of UAV technology in modern logistics operations.

Representing a major component of your marketing technology stack, are you utilizing all of the features and functionality MailChimp has to offer?\nOne of the reasons we recommend MailChimp to customers who will be managing their own email marketing campaigns is because it's one of the most user-friendly tools out there for this. In fact, if you receive our monthly newsletter, you've probably already noticed that we use it in-house, too.\nAs recently as 2009, studies showed that email was the most popular online activity, favored by 87% of North Americans as their primary online communication tool. As marketers, email is a quick way to communicate directly with customers.\nWe met with a new client recently who runs a brick and mortar retail store, and with the help of a Magento ecommerce solution we'll be implementing for them, they will soon be reaching a bigger market online.\nFor most of us today, email is an essential part of both our personal and work lives.

In this problem, we will focus on two buttons: `emailButton` and `helpButton`.\n\nYou need to write a method or function that takes an array of buttons and determines whether both the `emailButton` and `helpButton` are present in the array.\n\nWrite a function `areButtonsPresent(buttons: List[ToolStripButton]) -> bool` that takes a list of buttons as input and returns `True` if both `emailButton` and `helpButton` are present in the array, and `False` otherwise.\n\nNote:\n- Each button in the array is represented by an instance of the `System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton` class, as shown in the code snippet.\n- The `System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton` class is part of the .NET Framework and provides functionality for creating buttons in a toolbar.\n\nFunction Signature: `def areButtonsPresent(buttons: List[ToolStripButton]) -> bool:`\n\n**Example**\n\nInput:\n```python\nbutton1 = System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton()\nbutton2 = System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton()\nbutton3 = System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton()\nbutton4 = System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton()\n\nbuttons = [button1, button2, button3, button4]\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\nFalse\n```\n\nExplanation:\nIn this case, the `emailButton` and `helpButton` are not present in the array `buttons`, so the function should return `False`.\n\n---", "You are given a code snippet that handles the submission of answers for a quiz.

This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading \u2018 Common law \u2019) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], \u2018 Uniform law \u2019.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law\u2019s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme\u2019s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws: local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law", "With no explanation, chose the best option from \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Jackson, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 55, 126 L.Ed.2d 24 (1993);  Jones v. Suter, 508 U.S. 949, 113 S.Ct. 2439, 124 L.Ed.2d 657 (1993);  Jones v. Jackson, 506 U.S. 1047, 113 S.Ct. 962, 122 L.Ed.2d 119 (1993). Currently, Jones has at least two more petitions for certiorari pending.\n\n\n3\nWe enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Jones' abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases and so we limit our sanction accordingly.  The order will not prevent Jones from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed against him.  The order will, however, allo w this Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.\n\n\n4\nJustice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n6\nJustice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nFor the reasons I have previously expressed, I respectfully dissent.
